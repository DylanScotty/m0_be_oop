# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
These challenges were very difficult. I went down many rabbit holes looking for answers
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is manageable, so far I feel like I am able to complete everything that we have had.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I learned how to add an assignment operator to my method which was pretty neat. Also how to run a method multipule times when needed.
